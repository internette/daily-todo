  text: <p>Daily_ToDo is a desktop app that betters habits by gamifying to-do lists. Add to-do items that you do daily, such as check e-mails in the morning, remind yourself of your lunch break at noon, or even wash your face before you go to bed. By providing a system that allows you to cross of daily items, your day becomes more managable and less of the scary monster that everyone fears first thing in the morning.</p><p>You never have to worry about what you're missing with Daily_ToDo. Instead of removing an item upon completion, Daily_ToDo merely crosses of the item while keeping the item on your list. The list is persistent, so all items will be there the next day. At midnight, your list resets with no actions whatsoever, making your life easier.</p>
